== Fedora Container Naming

A Fedora Container Layered Image name should be the same as the the name of main service that it intends to provide end users.
Therefore, naming must follow the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Naming/[General Naming Guidelines]

None of the Fedora releases/DistGit-branch naming should be taken into consideration by the main container name, just as it is for RPM Package Naming.

Fedora content is now "namespaced" in https://src.fedoraproject.org/projects/container/%2A[DistGit], with the container namespace being 'container'.
